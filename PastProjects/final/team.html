                    <p>
                        Lynette operates and manages The Lost Coin, LLC, deploying over 30+ years

                    <p>
                        Lynette began her accounting career with the prestigious Arthur Andersen & Co
                        as an auditor. She spent nearly 10 years in various internal audit,
                        accounting, and finance positions at Hewlett-Packard Company, and also has

                        settlement program in the history of the United States. She also spent nearly
                        a year investigating allegations of embezzlement at a closely-held family
                        business, identifying stolen funds in excess of $1.6 million along with
                        fraudulently filed corporate tax returns and quarterly payroll reports.
