            <h2>Tax Resolution</h2>
            <p>
                Tax resolution is the process of helping individuals and businesses address and resolve
                issues with the IRS
                or state tax authorities. When someone falls behind on taxes, receives threatening letters,
                faces penalties,
                or is selected for an audit, the situation can quickly become overwhelming. Tax laws are
                complex, deadlines
                are strict, and mistakes or delays can lead to significant financial consequences. Tax
                resolution
                professionals step in to evaluate the situation, explain all available options, and guide
                taxpayers toward a
                strategy that protects their rights and reduces their financial burden. At the start of the
                process, a tax
                resolution specialist conducts a detailed review of the taxpayer’s
                financial records, income, expenses, and prior filings. This allows them to identify the
                root cause of the
                problem—whether it’s unpaid balances, unfiled returns, payroll tax issues, incorrect
                reporting, or IRS
                notices that have escalated. From there, they determine which solutions best fit the
                individual’s financial
                position and the IRS's requirements. Common strategies include negotiating installment
                agreements,
                submitting an Offer in Compromise to settle tax debt for less than the full amount,
                requesting penalty
                abatement, proving financial hardship, or securing “Currently Not Collectible” status when
                payment is
                temporarily impossible. For businesses, solutions may also involve resolving payroll tax
                disputes or
                negotiating trust fund recovery penalties.
