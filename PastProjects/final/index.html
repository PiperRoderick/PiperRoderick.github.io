                The Parable of the Lost Coin
                 “Or suppose a woman has ten silver coins and loses one. Doesn’t she light a lamp, sweep the house and
                search carefully until she finds it?  And when she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbors
                together
                and says, ‘Rejoice with me; I have found my lost coin.’  In the same way, I tell you, there is rejoicing
                in
                the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.”

                            tax return, so I phoned Lynette. She responded quickly, and resolved the issues in a matter
                            of days. She took the time to educate me on how to set up systems and processes to keep my
                            business on track.</p>

                        <p>We started getting threatening letters from the IRS for prior year tax returns that we did
                            not realize we needed to file as we had been out of the country. Then we discovered
                            significant mistakes on more recently filed returns made by another tax preparer. We hired
                            Lynette to assist us in resolving our IRS problems. She keeps us updated regularly, and she
                            is knowledgeable and detailed in her work. She is also helping us get our business records
                            more organized so we can keep this from happening again. What a huge relief!</p>
